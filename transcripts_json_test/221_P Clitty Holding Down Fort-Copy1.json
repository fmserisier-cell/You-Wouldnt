Well actually about a week to go because we're getting on tour in about a week's time. So if you're listening and you're in Melbourne, Sydney, Perth, Adelaide, Brisbane, guess what? We're going to be there from the 26th of November, so get your tickets in our bio. See us there. That was Pat. That was hilarious. Right? Oh hello from you wooden, one of the greatest podcast. Hello to you all. Good morning, good afternoon, good night to you all. I'll see you for the next hour. How was that? Oh, here we go. I just saw you frantically. Yeah, I was like, this is perfect. I look over at a gold and be like, how's he going? The gun's frantically trying to look for the button on the road cast and it was all worse. I thought you were going to give me crickets. I appreciate that. Now you might be thinking, holy. It's just Pat. That's all it is. It's just me to solo it. Why? Cuz Will, yesterday was like, hey bro, I'm going to Melbourne tomorrow. I was like, right, oh cunt. It's a little bit late notice. And I was like, fuck it. I could scavenge a last minute guest out and it's like, this is the thing about guests, it's got to be someone I know well, you know what I mean? Like I don't, I don't, I don't. I don't really want to sit down one on one with someone unless I'm genuinely interested in them, you know what I mean? And there was no one I'm genuinely interested in that I could get in the time frame. I'm not going to get someone for the sake of it. Obviously someone like my friends would have been fun too, but I was like it. I'm going to crank out a solo pod. We still got Kaiki here as well who's burping off camera. I'd love to know, Kyle, because it's the day of look, it's, it's. And I'm not even being a dickhead. It's seriously one of the greatest days of the year. Like, I love State of Origin. It is so good. It is one of the greatest days of the year. I want to know what your plans are. Well, it's a bit boring. It's not. I'm not. I'm just going home. I'm just gonna watch it at home. Oh, that's wholesome with the fam. Nah, the parents are out. I'll have a few boys over. Yeah, nice. I reckon that's what Origins are watching originally. Really keen. Yeah. Last year I watched at the pub and. Unless it's the idiot. Oh hell. What was that? What was that? It's an email. What's it say? You got to read it out. It's like in class. You ever do that in school if. You got a Dear Kyle, you have aids. Oh, cut the pod. Cut it here. Did. We'll get to you. Did he? Yeah. You know, in school and like if your phone vibrated, the teacher would be like. If your phone goes off, you got to read out the text. It's like, hang on a second. That's a bit of an invasion of privacy. Rah. Like you can't be forcing me to read out my texts. That's. Anyway, I reckon that's what State of Origin Foot is about. Unless you go into the Chloe Hotel. Now the pub's good. Well, I like vibes and then you get the one like. But I like to sit and listen. This is footy in general, not just Origin. I don't. Obviously if you. If you're out and you're having beers and you're watching the foot, it's fun. But if I actually genuinely want to watch a game, I'll. I like sitting watching it and listening to the commentary with some friends around, you know, like I shush the boys before origins. I want to listen. Yeah. But it's always nice having like a couple Maroon supporters. It is good to. To rub some salt in the wound to the. To the two headed freaks. Yeah. I'll be at the Chloe Hotel in saying. But then I'm gonna go to the boys house before kickoff. I'm gonna. Me and Pat Doherty are gonna host a little event there for games 1, 2 and 3. So just the pre game. Just the pre game. Yeah. Yeah. Right. We give away. I'll come down and watch. Come down. We give away. It's actually really fun if you know, if you can come for games two or three. We give away prizes. Jugs of bees. Last Year we gave away signed Andrew John's footies. I think a surfboard Eskis. I don't know. There's heaps of to give away. It's funny but yeah, it's. It's the greatest day of the year now. Few things to get through our Patreon. We were talking about it the other week, right. And Will brought up a great point. If you're not in the Patreon and you sign up now, you get to go back and watch all the old content. It's 455 hours of content. How many days is that? 465 is it couldn't be that many, could it? 19 days. 19 days. So if you signed up now, you could sit there for 19 days straight and listen and then you wouldn't be complaining. You don't have enough content. Another thing quickly, because people are getting charged 1450 by the Patreon. If you are sign up on the website, that is not us, that's Patreon's doing through iOS. Apple take a large percentage. So if you sign up on the website, you'll get charged the $10. If you. If you sign up on the app, apparently you get charged like $14 or something. That money doesn't go to us, that goes to Apple. The fuck. Like you need more money. Cunt. Fucking Apple. The kunt who created it's dead. Anyway, that's that. And I just feel like. What else is on the list? I just feel this is just. This is housekeeping rules, guys. This isn't the episode. I want you to know that. We're getting into a fun episode. I'm just doing some housekeeping rules because we're going on tour. We're doing a regional tour. They might be thinking regional. Oh, come to Bathurst. Come to this. No, mate, we're not going that regional. We're going Newcastle, Newcastle, Newcastle. We're going Wollongong. We're going Penrith, which isn't regional. But you guys, everyone from out west comes to the shows in Sydney. So we thought we'd bring one to you because you're sick cunts. And we're going to Canberra. So that's going to be early July. Tickets will go on sale. Look, I'm working around the clock at booking in venues. So hopefully next week tickets are going to go on sale early July. So get barred the up for that. Now let's get into the episode. Kyle, you're not going to be on tour because you're going to Europe. Yes, lad. When do you fly out? Lid? 23Rd of June. That soon? Three weeks. And you're going for how long? Five weeks. Hell, you really just. So you went to Japan, you went to Europe? Is Europe just the boys or is it a fam thing this year? Yeah. Going with, like, couple mates. Just you guys? Yeah. How does it work? Went to Southeast Asia last year. Yeah, but that's. You stay with relatives there, it doesn't count. What? That's not a holiday, mate. That's a homecoming. Japan. What are you gonna say about Japan? Another one. I'm talking holidays, mate. That's just like me saying I go to the central coast and call it a holiday at home. What about when you go back to Russia? Me? Yeah, Home, Home. You know what I mean? Yeah, the heartland fair lad. Me and Khabib smash chicken. We wrestle bears out there, mate. So this is just, like, fool the boys. How does it go on a family holiday? Do you. Do you still scavenge flights off your parents at your age? Exactly. You're getting them ones. Because I reckon if I went away now. Surely they're paying for flight if you're staying with your family and everything. No, I don't reckon. I. I reckon it's all. You're all on your hell. In fact, I think when I went to America when I was 19, it was. Nah. Com was covered. I think everything else was. You're all on your own, brother. But when we'd go out for dinner and that, they'd obviously pay. That's rough. But you had. You were working at the airport, though. You were making good money. Yeah. Do we not pay you enough? Huh? Well, I'm still at uni, mate, so. Is that what you're saying? Yeah. You want to rise? I'd love a rise. All right. Speak to the bosses, bro. I'd love to go to Japan, though. I really would. I certainly. If I can do the flight, bruh. It's like. I know it's nine hours, but flights are just. What's it to Perth, like, five? Yeah, mate, that's. That's the same. After watching Lilo and Stitch, I really want to go to Hawaii. That's what I really want to do. I've been there as well. Hell, mate, where haven't you been? You're like a world I haven't been to. I'd have been everywhere. Been everywhere. Where's one place you haven't gone? Where you'd love to go? My top would be Hawaii, Japan. And somewhere I haven't been. Maybe just, like, a bit more. I'd love to go to like the Maldives and just relax for a few days. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Kick back on one of the nets and just get your naukle out and. Go for a swim or like Canada. Oh yeah, I'd love to go to Canada actually. That's a good one. You love your snow and that's. Yeah, you love your snow as well, don't you? Are you referring to cocaine? Is that what you're referring to? That'd be inappropriate. Well then what were you referring to? As in like the ice. Snow, Ice, snow and ice. Well then what snow was I talking about? The other one, so. And you said yes. Yeah. Which makes you love. So you love cocaine. Yeah. Okay, that's good. Hopefully your parents don't listen to this, mate. No wonder why you can't afford flights. You spend 250 to 300 a weekend on bags. Throw an extra 150 to 200 on cat. I don't know how much that costs these days. So the other night, me and Will. What day is it today? Thursday. Tonight we're going to release the full Bring her back video on YouTube, I think. Okay. So you can head to our YouTube at 6:00 clock and we're gonna. We sat down with Denny and Michael. Now listen, I don't know if we're going to be invited back because this is the thing we're gonna invited to like the proper press, like interviews. Right. With Danny and Michael for Bring Her Back. Now we were like, well, we can't go in there with two of the most chaotic people you've ever met. Me. And we're being pretty chaotic ourselves. We can't just. We're not just gonna be able to sit down and be like. So guys, tell us how your heart felt in. During this movie. You know, it's just not us. And we went in there all guns blazing and it was good fun, we enjoyed it. But we walked out of there going, holy Sony, absolutely hate us or love us. And there was. I don't think there was any in between. So head to the YouTube, check it out. Now, I was meant to watch the movie before and I didn't because that scares me over the last couple years. I love horror movies, but the last few years things like demons and ghosts and have really spooked me and send my anxiety through the roof. So I was like, I don't know if I want to go and watch it because Talk to Me. Their first movie I really loved, but I watched that before all this started, so it's going to be really similar Anyway. The premiere came around, everyone was going. Tiana really wanted to go. I was like, it. I'll just. I'll brave it out and I'll give it a crack. And boy, am I glad I did because Bring Her Back is such a good film. Like, it is really such a good movie. I'm not just saying this for the sake of it. Like, I would give my honest opinion. I gave it four stars on letterboxd. Let me read out my letterboxd review, actually, because it was just like. It wasn't scary in the sense of like, obviously it was scary. It was a horror. But it wasn't like a, oh, fuck, like what's gonna happen next horror. It was more like, oh, that's your. I sent Denny and Michael a mess saying, you kinds of twisted individuals for coming up with this. But it was amazing, you know what I mean? Like, that's what it's kind of like they portrayed the message. There's obviously a clear. A clear like theme, should I say, rather than a message. There's a clear theme in the movie that it's not hard to understand what it is that they portray really well. And just the way they did it all was so good. And again, you. I want Will to do a proper breakdown on it because he knows the more movie terms. I just really enjoyed it from a movie perspective. Me and Will always talk about how things make you feel. Like, how long does it take you to digest the movie and I you not. I'm still thinking about it the. The night after I Woke up at 4am and I couldn't get back to sleep for about half an hour to an hour as I just kept thinking of the movie. Not necessarily like scared. I just like, I was just processing it then the whole next day. Yesterday I was processing it and today I've still thought about it here and there. Like, it's a lot to break down and it's just. It's a great movie. Bring her Back. Four stars. Unfucking believable movie. I'm still processing it from last night. Twisted movie in a great way portrayed the message amazingly in just a proper of a doozy movie. That was what I said. So if you don't like horror, obviously it is horror, but it's not like your typical horror, you know what I mean? So I would recommend maybe giving it a go. Unless you're like fully against all that completely. But it wasn't. It's hard to explain. It wasn't like demonistic, like Talk to Me where like they're letting Demons inside them and stuff like this. It was more just the message and the way they did it was unbelievable. So I really recommend going and watch her bring her back. It was. It was great. Carl, after I just spilled my heart out about that movie. Do you reckon you'll go watch it? No. No. So you're just like, completely. No. Yeah. I don't watch horror movies, mate. Just nothing. I told you before, when I said it before. Say it again. When. When I'd be at sleepovers and the. Boys would be like, this is heavy, bruh. I'd curl up in the corner and watch a bit of YouTube, mate. So that. Because that's a tradition right here in Australia. Anyway, you have a sleepover, you're putting on the. You watch like your conjurings and whatever. The garages you're fighting, you're getting. You're getting freaky and you'd full. Just sit in the corner. Watch YouTube. Yeah. I couldn't do it. What would you watch? Smosh. What's smart? What's small? You know, Smosh. Like, what the. I'm gonna show you. I remember that show, Mosh, that army show, bro, that dad will. Oh, I'll put Mosh on, like off. I'm not putting on Mosh. You've got a lot. You've got a lot of Smosh. Actually, there's Smosh games. Smart. They're just like this group that do a lot of different. I've never seen them in my life. Oh, my God. Who are these people? Now. It'S grown a bit. Has it? So it's just like a YouTube group? Yeah, it's a YouTube group. Yeah. These people. This is the OG Smosh. Oh, they kind of look familiar. That's what I'd watch. Pretty embarrassing. Did the boys used to give it to you? Yeah, but I just couldn't do it. Like, I just cough. It's good on you for sticking true to your word. Was there a bad experience as to why you didn't like. Have you ever watched one? And you're like. That turned me off. Horror movies forever. I don't know. I think we just have never braved. Yeah, because this is what got me. This is what got me to go watch it. And I know this is a bit more deep than your issue because yours isn't a anxiety issue. Yours just. You don't like them. But my therapist always says to me, if you don't go do something, it's never going to improve your chances of going and doing it. You know what I mean? So, like, before I went to watch it, I was like, I really don't want to watch it. And then I just saw to my therapist being like, okay, but that then you're not growing or getting comfortable in an uncomfortable environment. You know what I mean? So, obviously I sat down and at the movies, I was quite uncomfortable, right? I don't like the movies in general because I find it boring to sit there and not talk for a period of time. And my mind just ticks over the first half an hour. Like when we sat down waiting for the movie to start, all I was thinking was, which I do everywhere I go, if a terrorist comes, how do I get out? You know what I mean? I was thinking for half an hour before the movie started, if a gunman walks in and starts shooting, could I put Tiana underneath the recliner chair and close the chair? And she would be tucked up under there and no one would see her, Right? You don't want to live in my brain. I promise you that. You don't want to. Where would you go? I'm running, bro. Hey, I'm not fitting under no recliner chair. But I've. I. I swear to God, bro, for 30 minutes, I'm. I'm wondering if Tiana could curl up in a ball and I close the recliner chair. Wouldn't that be a great Heidi? He's so slow, though. It would be slow, but that's a sacrifice you make, you know? And then, God forbid, she doesn't fit. Then you're both. But they're the things that I'm thinking. I'm like, then what if it doesn't work? How much time have I wasted? Like, the gunman starting to make their way up. You know what I mean? Always think I would just go to the. You know how the stairs, like, progressively go lower? You know what I mean? At the cinemas that they go down towards the exit. Like, the stairs go down? Yeah, yeah. I reckon I'll just jump from the top straight down to, like, the. Because you can drop, right? You know how. There's the railing. I would just go straight over the edge. Bra. Copper. Copper. Copper. Broken ankle or something. Yeah, because they're coming up the stairs. You just jump over the edge. You just jump over the edge. You know what I mean? If he gets you on the fly, he gets you on the fly. Or she. I'm not gonna. I'm not gonna gender terrorists, but in my experience of what I've seen, they're mostly males, but so, yeah, look, you don't want to be in my brain. But that's what I was thinking for the most part of the beginning of the movie. But then, yeah, my therapist always says you got to go and face these fears, otherwise you're never going to get over them, you know what I mean? And you never, you've got to get comfortable in them. So I did it and I'm glad I did because it was a great experience and a great movie. Now we're going to move on to a game we played in the Patreon last week. Some people calling it the greatest Patreon episode ever. I didn't think it was that good, but I thought it was fun. And it was called the ranking game where you rank things. So me and Will went through and ranked our favorite Aussie chocolates on like a tier list, you know what I mean? There's goat, there's like elite, there's ooh, put it in the bin, there's chat. Can't never touch it with a two foot pole, you know what I mean? There's all these things and mean we'll have to agree together. So I'm like, I want to do one of my own now. Not of chocolates, of course, of something different and see how we go. See what I rank just on my own, which I think will be a bit of fun. If anyone's still listening to this podcast, are you enjoying the pod? I am. Me too. But let me just say one thing. We're going on two 1. It's starting from the 26th, it's in literally like a week. So we're going to Melbourne, Adelaide, Perth, Brisbane and the final O show in Sydney. Get your ticks, be a part of the night of Nights, History of wars. If you like the podcast, see it live.

They've got milk, fruit, fruit, bread, just carbs They've got bread, pasta, and oats. Go back, bro. Last time we opened this, there was galores at everything. Maybe snacks or fast food. Can you do fast food Australia? That would be great. Fast food Australia. Australia. Fast food. Teal is Australia edition. Here we go. All right, here we go. That's gross. So go the top. Go red. You don't have to watch this. You can listen, but it'd be good if you watch. So the top tier is going to be goat. Then let's go elite. Now we gotta chat. You got to change it up. Go goat. Then go. Got. It's just an A short of goat. Know what I mean? So it's pretty good. It's the greatest of time. Yeah, but you know what I mean? It's like you're so close, but you're just a little bit not there. Or maybe greatest of sometimes, because that's like greatest of all time. Okay, I'll cop that. Then do. Pretty good. Then do. Nice. Then do. Not great. Then do. If I was starving, Then do. That's disgusting. Then do. Would rather starve to death. All right, here we go. Off the bat, the first one looks like something I've never seen before. What is that? Sandwich. Chefs, can you see this? All right, I can see that. All right. Yeah, Sam. Okay, so there's. There's about just. Just skimming across is about three that I've never heard of. So, Sam, I wonder if we can. Just get rid of them. Yeah, just the cun off. Just don't do it. Just put it at the end. Put it at the end. Rolled. Okay. Interesting. Rolled being a Vietnamese takeaway place. I'm sick. I'm sick for a Vietnamese roll. A bar, me, and rice paper rolls. But I'm more of a. The dirtier the place, the better it tastes when it comes to this stuff. What do you reckon? Yeah, I'm very particular about my Vietnamese rolls. And. And rolled's almost too fresh. You know what I mean? Like, there's not a cockroach or a rat in their kitchen, and I want that. I'm thinking of Hong Ha in mascot. The. The elite. You know what I mean? The. The trendsetter, the. The Pope of Vietnamese shops. Right? So I'm going to put rolled in. Not great. It's not. It's not great. It really. It isn't great. You know what? I'm gonna put it on. If I was starving, if I was starving, I would eat rolled. But I've never, ever gone once. I think I have. I said, because I was Walking past as I'll get rolled. What's next? Sushi. Sushi. Sushi. Sushi. Never heard of it. Domino's. Okay, interesting. If we're talking pizza takeaway crust is my first option. But Domino's isn't bad. I think it gets a bad rap, put it that way. I don't think Domino's is appreciated enough for what it is. And I'm going to put it in nice. It's pretty nice. Guzman y Gomez. The most. The single most overrated food chain in Australia. And it's not even a question, mate. The shittest Mexican you can get as takeaway is Guzman y Gomez in my opinion. And I'm putting it in. That's disgusting. Which is a bold call. But I don't like it, mate. I don't like. I don't not like it. Like don't get me. I don't bite it and go hey yuck, cunt. But I don't get it. You know what I mean? There's much better Mexican takeaway out there. Pizza Hut is. They're falling off the face of the earth. Pizza Huts, where I'm from, there's only one that I can think of and I haven't had it in years. So I'm gonna have to just go off. Why are they shutting down everywhere? Because it's not great. But I will say this. The old all you can eat Pizza Hut in Gold Coast. I don't know if you ever went to. It was unbelievable. I remember I was 10 and I ate so much pizza that I cried in the car park and we had to go home. I was in the car park trying to vomit and I was crying and everyone else was inside like taking it slow and I had like a self serve Mr. Whippy. They had everything and I was like, I'm in so much pain, mom, I gotta go home. And. And I made everyone leave and everyone was off me. How many slices do you reckon you got? A 10 year old fetty Petty would have got through a few a. I get a pizza and a half and a few soft serves. That is a 10 year old bra. But I don't know if I ate the crust because my dad would say don't eat the crust. It fills you up. Yeah. Toppings. Just get the toppings. Yeah. What's this? I've never seen that. I think that's an American one. Carl's Jr. Cold Rock. This is super interesting. Again you ask 10 year old Pat where cold rock goes straight to the goat. Something about maturity and age. It's a beautiful thing in life and it makes you real life realize Cold Rock is one of the biggest rip offs of all time. And my parents used to always tell me it they say mate, cold Rock is the biggest jip ever. And I used to disagree and I used to think it was really nice. And the last time I got wasn't good. And I'm gonna put it in. Not great, but it's good for kids. Cold Rock is great for kids. If all the kids were wiped out tomorrow, Cold Rock would go bankrupt by. By Friday the next day. That's what I reckon. What do we got next? Rice workshop. See you, cunt. See you, mate. Carl's family business. Sumo. I don't know if I've ever eaten this. I've seen it. I know that logo. I think it's like noodles and stuff. Get rid of it, Papa Rich. Get rid of it. Sushi Hub. Here we go. Sushi being one of the greatest foods ever. It seriously is. Even though I don't like seafood, it is one of the greatest foods ever. Okay. The thing about Sushi Hub is they have such a great variety. They've got these like, like fried vegetable fritter things that are just out of this world. They have little. The little ones like Nagiri's. I think they're called that Nigeries. What are the ones? You know, the ones you get from this. Had to be careful there. And they've just got a great selection, bro. The rolls are a little bit small at Sushi Hub, I'll be honest. But they don't shy away from the mayo and everything like that. I'm gonna be putting Sushi Hub in a ghost. It is really good and I love sushi. The Sushi Train is elite. Like that's the goat. The. It's literally just called Sushi Train. It's a franchise. That's the goat of sushi. Shout out to. Boom. Sushi and mascot. Also pretty good. Mad Mex. My go to for Indian or Zambreros. Indian. Mexican. Bloody hell. Listen, I don't mind smacking back a bit of Mexi. I'm gonna put it in. This is the thing. I like Mexican food, but it's. I don't think it's the best for takeaway in general. I don't think like a good sit down in a Mexican restaurant is very yum. I don't think it's the best takeaway food as such. Although a takeaway burrito is quite good. But that's where I. That's where I hit up Zambreros. As of late. What are you saying? Put Mad Mex in Nice, please. It is nice. It's nice. That's all it is. Kufka. Kfc. A big one, a controversial one, because nothing screams feel amazing while eating and feel awful when you're done. Like kfc. You know what I mean? It's like. I don't know what. I don't know what to compare it to. You feel so good in the moment. Listen, it's like mdma. That's what KFC is like in the moment. There's not many things that come better than the Colonel. The next day after a cap, you feel rubbish. The next. As soon as you finish that last bit of kfc, you feel awful. And I don't get it. Heaps. But their popcorn chicken is so elite. It has to go in pretty good. It has to, but it is pretty good. But it may be a little bit overrated. But their popcorn chicken puts them. If there wasn't popcorn chicken, they're honestly in the. Not great. I reckon maybe they're in Nice. Nah, that's better than Domino's and Mad Max. Yeah, it's pretty good, but you do feel sick after it. Schnitz is an interesting one. If it was more accessible, I think I would eat it a lot more, but I don't. And then normally only in, like, food courts in, like, shopping centers where I've seen schnitz. And every time I've eaten it, it's been pretty nice. Been pretty nice. So I'd put it in. Oh, you said I put it in. Nice just because I haven't had it enough. But if I'd had it more, I reckon it. It gets a good run for pretty good, in my opinion. Subway. This is tough. Subway is so delicious. It's convenient. It's got different varieties. You got a cookie to top it all off. No matter what you're feeling, you can have it at Subway for a sandwich. You know what I mean? Subway's going in my ghost. I don't get it a lot, but it slaps every time you get. Absolutely slaps every time you get it. It's going in a ghost. Salsas I've never had. What's that? Donut King. Yeah. Donut King's good. Brother Lonnie's been smacking back donut kings lately. A good cinnamon toner from Donut King. It's gotta go in pretty good. They have some good in there. I'd love a Baker's Delight in here, too. Go a long way. Grilled right oh, grilled pops a bit of hate. I reckon you're someone who loves grilled. Grilled is so good. Oh, yeah, you struck. But I reckon it cops a bit of hate. Have you had the healthy fried chicken burgers? Nah, man. How healthy is it? I don't know, but they're. You know what I mean? Yeah, but I'm not saying it because they're healthy. Like they're actually done. That's what I'd love to know. It's a great marketing. Healthy burgers. It's a great marketing scheme. I'd love to know how healthy they actually are. Sweet potato fries as well. There's no way they're healthy, bro. They're deep fried to the. Yeah, they do well, though, because it feels like a proper healthy meal. Yeah, that's why it's such good marketing, the way they do it. And it is yum. It is very yummy. Again, I don't have it heat, so I'd put it in nice. It is an idiot. Grilled is nice is what it is. They do good herb chips too. Great herb chips. Hungry Jacks. The burgers are better. You reckon? I'll tell you what is better. Your onion rings. Your onion rings are unreal. At Hungry Jacks. That's all I really get from there. I'm not a big Hungry Jacks person, so I would put it in nice. But their onion rings are unbelievable. Similar to KFC and popcorn chicken without onion rings. Hungry Jacks is a gimp. You know what I mean? But. But it really brings it up. Golden arches. We come. We come to a moment in the game where you reach the golden arches and you knew it was coming. We're talking takeaway. We're talking fast food. And it's not even a question. McDonald's goes straight to the top of goat. Yep. And it deserves to be there alone. You know what I mean? Like, there is no. Maccas is elite. It is superior to every other takeaway joint. Could you argue against that? Yeah, I think there's one that. That matches it. That's actually not on this list. Okay, we'll get to that. I want to get to that at the end because I want to see if I put it there. Rick Red Rooster just put it in. Not great because I've. I don't have it much, but when I've looked at it, I don't just want a roast chicken gravy roll takeaway. If I want one of them, I'll go to like a gourmet chicken shop. A Porto's All Porto's good, bro. A Porto's very good. I almost wanna. So I want to put it in pretty good, but it's a tier above kfc, I think. Put it in Ghost. I'm a sucker for like Portuguese chicken burgers, but it's not like Olay and that do it way better. Olay you've ever had Ole, brother. Have you had Olay, Willy? It's bruh. It's so. So the thing with Portuguese chicken burgers, I think they taste better at like a. I know Olay's got a couple restaurants, but more of an independent kind of place rather than a franchise. But Oporto, it does a job for you and it's in a ghost. Oliver's is not great, bro. You're getting it at the servo. No, Oliver's is. If I was starving. If I was starving, I'd eat it on a road trip, you know what I mean? Pie face. Don't. Haven't had enough. Get rid of Nando's. Say Will would throw this straight into goat, I reckon. But I'm gonna throw Nando's into. Look, it's good, but it's not. It's nice. Nando's is nice. It's nice. It's almost not great. Nah, it's nice. It deserves that Zambrero. Sombrero is pretty good. Their burritos really slap and that's all I've had from there. I'm a news. I'm a newcomer to zambrero. Like I said, I don't get Mexican takeaway that much. When I do, it's been zambrero lately. When I do, it's mainly only been a burrito and they go hard. Hogs say you can't. No idea. Krispy Kreme can. Hell, this is the last one. I don't know any others on there. Krispy Kreme. This is really throwing a spanner in the works, bruh. A Krispy Kreme donut. If you put a box in front of me and say to eat as many as you can, the calories don't count. I reckon I'd get close to 50. I seriously reckon I would, bro. They're so delicious, it's unbelievable. I'm gonna put them. I just. Nothing can sit in goat with maccas, you know what I mean? Maccas, I feel like earns a spot to sit by itself. So I got to put Krispy Kreme in Ghost also. It's a little bit less variety, you know what I mean? And there's My list. Goat Maccas, Ghost Sushi, Subway or Porto Krispy Kreme. Pretty good. Kfc, Donut King, Zambrero. Nice. Domino's, Mad Mex Schnitz, Grilled Hungry Jacks. Nando's not great. Pizza Hut, cold rock, Red Rooster. Put Red Rooster in if I was starving. Put Olivers in. That's disgusting. Not great. Pizza Hut, cold rock if I was starving. Rolled Red Rooster. That's disgusting. Guzman. Oliver's would rather starve to death. Nothing there. I want to put Nando's in Knock. Nah, Nando's is nice. Nando's is good. I like that. I'm happy with that to you. What about. Where would you put Ogalo? Is that your go? Yeah. See, this is. That's the deal. A gallo. Like a. It's a good Portuguese chicken burger. Bra. I haven't had a gallo in a long time, though, I'll admit, because if I'm going for a big Portuguese chicken burger, I'm going olay. That's wrong. That's probably your agalo. Yeah. I would put maccas in untouchable and I'll lay in goat. That's what I'd do. Wait. Oh, chili scared the out of me. That's what I'd do, bro. Mine's going. That's going in goat for me. Oh, gallo. Yeah, it's pretty good, eh? It's pretty. It's pretty delicious, Ladies. What it is. All right, that's my ranking. Let us know if you Watch this on YouTube. Comment below. What you change, what you do different, what you'd add. Little bit this, little bit of that. You know what I'm saying? Now we're going to do a thing. Me and Will have a tradition of doing general knowledge, right? And I always complain we don't get enough sport questions. In particular, I'm always like, if I got NRL questions, like, I would in here. You know what I mean? Like, wouldn't even be a competition. And I thought it. Maybe now's the time to test my knowledge and see if I'm actually as good as. Obviously, I would beat Will. But I've got Cole to write down some NRL questions and I want to just test my knowledge because it is my. If I had to say what sports, my sport, it'd be nrl, then it'd be daylight. There's nothing coming close. It's. It's the goat sport. These are. These are pretty hard, though. So I wanna. Yeah, I wanted to, like, I wouldn't. I wouldn't give these in a general. Knowledge okay, so these are like. These are pretty hard. All right. And let me know verse me. I want you to verse me at home. You know what I mean? Like, see if you can get it before me. If you can get it right. How many we got? We've got 11. 11? What do you reckon if I got 8 out of 11? I'd be really. Oh, yeah, that's really. I reckon if you get five, I'll be impressed. Really. Okay. All right. Billy Slater produced his famous chip and chase try in which origin series? Okay. It wasn't O5. That was when John's went bananas. That was when Minnie scored off the post. I would say they're in collar jersey still. That. That jersey I've got's got a collar. That would have been, I would say 2008, 2004. Really? Jesus Christ. Behind Cameron Smith, who is the next most capped maroon? You know, I'm really getting found out here. I'm thinking like a big Artie Beatson. But then I'm like, I'm not sure how old Arty. I know Arty grew Origin. He. He is Origin, but I don't know how old he was when it started. Like Cameron Smith would have that many games behind Cameron Smith. Not hard. Oh, it's not Arty and it's not hard. It's not hard. So you've had JT Missed a few series, I think. Are you smiling? I was thinking jt But I swear he missed that one. Well, that was that. That was that game three. And he played and he did his ACL not crisis the most tries. Is it J.T. It'S J.T. Yeah. Yeah. Gave that away a little bit. That's all right. James Maloney played for how many clubs? NRL clubs. All right. Played for Panthers. He played for Sharks. He played for Roosters. He played for Warriors. He played for Cowboys. 5. Yeah. Nice hectic Central coast lad. James. Jimmy. In the 1999 grand final. Yes. Jamie Ainscough conceded a penalty. Penalty try for a hit. On which player? Oh, 99. That was Brisbane or Melbourne? I. Was that Brisbane or Melbourne one? Can you tell me the team? I think it was Brisbane. Brisbane. Was it Melbourne? Okay, 99. What was the player? That's the question. Yeah. Oh, Jamie Ainscough. Ainscough. So Melbourne won it? I've got no idea. Let's go with. Let me tell you which team. Yeah. Storm. He so the ball. Yeah. So this Ainskoff can't play for Dragons? Yeah. God, who would have played for Storm back then, bruv? On the wink Slater wouldn't have debuted on the wing then. No way. I don't know their wingers. I'm just going to say Slater. But it's not Craig Smith. No idea. Brett Kimberly made his debut for which club? You really tested me out here. Brett Kimmel. Oh, Brett Kamali. So different. Tigers. Oh, Brett Kamali. Sorry. No, I was thinking of Brett Hodgson. No, hang on, hang on. Brett Kamali. Brett Kamali debuted. I'm. Is it the Bulldogs nights? I'm so at this. I'm so at this. Who's the most capped New South Wales Blues player? Most capped. First person who came to mind was Paul Gallon. But Freddie Fittler. Yeah. Yeah. Which foundation club was remitted? Readmitted to the 2000. Should have never let him back in. Scumbags. And they're trying to come to Allianz. Mate. You can't off back to Homebush. Yeah. Low Life club. Low life team. How many NRL premierships have Cowboys won? Just one. Correct. Yeah. When did. What am I on here? You've got. I've got at least five. Two, three, four, five. You've got five. Three more. When did the gold coat. When did the titans join the NRL? 2000. Sorry. This. Eight. 2007. Oh. I was literally tossing up between seven and eight. Can't. Who won the Clive Churchill medal in the 2005 grand final? Tigers versus Cowboys. Had to have been Benji, wouldn't it? Scott Prince. Should have thought about that more. You should get this. Should have thought about that more. Which medal is awarded to the Rooster's best and fairest player? Jack Gibson medal. Well done. Teddy won it five years in a row when he first came to the club. Five years in a row. The C won it, bro. That's unbelievable. That's disappointing. Brass. 6 out of 11. That's pathetic is what that is. That was really fun. I'm not happy with that. You know what I mean? That's just like. That's lad. That's what that is. Righto. Now we put up. I'm just looking at some of these. There's a lot of his. Kyle single questions. I might get you to go on the Instagram and read out some. Oh yeah, some quotes. So I put up a question box yesterday of saying, listen, I'm riding solo. Help a brother out and ask me some questions. How did you and Will become friends? How do me and. We'll become friends? Main Will became friends through Shep. So Will went to primary school with Shep. Then me and Shep played footy together outside of school. So when we were like five or six, I was like best friends with Shep. And then Will and Shep were also best friends from school and their families were really close, so we'd always go to the footy together. So, like Brad, Shep's dad, Jeremy, Will's dad. And then Brad would invite my dad and then all the kids would go, you know what I mean? And then Shep introduced me to Will. Then we all started becoming friends through the footy. And then whenever we'd go on family holidays, Shep would bring me along as like the plus one friend. So the Gibbs and the Shepherds would go away together. Then, hey, Will would bring one of his friends. Shep would bring one of his friends, which was me. And then we all just became friends through that, all got along and then started hanging out. When. When will you run a half marathon? Do the runaway one in Central Coast? They're saying, I don't know when that is. I would like to do a half marathon by the end of the year. When I first. When I started running, like whatever it was 10 weeks ago, whatever I said to Tiana, by the end of the year, I want to do a half marathon and I'll run or run a five kilometer in 25 minutes. That's what I set myself as a goal. Five kilometers. It's a quick five kilometer. Yeah. Oath. That's more. I think that's more unlikely than a half marrow for me at the moment. And I. But I also want to do the half marathon in like it. Like, I could probably just go run one right at like 10 kilometer pace. But I want to do it like a decent. Yeah. Yeah. Thing, you know, maybe I couldn't actually. It's a long. It'd be double the 10. That's all. 10 was pretty good, but the last K I was feeling it. That was no, like, no training or prep or anything really. For a 10K, that is. Favorite song at the moment. Favorite song at the moment. I've been loving Millionaire by Chris Stapleton. I've been blaring some Chris Stapleton lately. Obviously Zachy B. Is always there and thereabouts. Or Hometown Glory by Adele, Home Sound and I've been listening to I Drink Wine Too. That hotline caller gave in. But yeah, that'd be my top two, I reckon. Made in worries of free argument. She's top of my list now to see if people haven't seen yet. Morgan Wallen's come back to Australia. I'm there, but people haven't seen it. Got to Be Adele, right? She's a goat. For your golf game. If you could improve either your driver, chipping or putting, what would you choose? Okay, So what are we talking? Improve like what? Like, are we talking like you're a base at one of them? Yeah, let's say you're like a tour. Like you're a tour player. Like tour players skill level at that thing. It would be chipping or putting. Like I slice my dry, but I could. I don't practice that enough. And I. Even off the tee, I can hit an iron. I can still smoke it pretty well. So like I can always get a good. If I hit a good T shirt, I can always get a good T shirt off. It'd probably be putting. That's. What do you mean, bro? It's the stroke. How, bruh? Once. If you can get on me, Bruh, sometimes I. 2, 3, part putting. Imagine. You can imagine you sink consistent 8, 8, 10 footers. But like imagine if you could drive like a pro. Like that's. It's drive would be my last one. If I get a hold of a ball, I could draw. I've driven at 280 before, you know what I mean? Like if I get a hold of it, I'm not. Yeah, when you get a hold of it. But yeah, but I reckon I prove. That putting's the easiest to improve. That's the worst answer. Do you reckon? Yeah. Okay. What about why Cebo Sabo's a mad golfer. Within 10 meters of where you want it. Yeah. Yeah, that's true. I think you can fix. I played yesterday. Scored like, didn't free up cutting you. Can you maybe you guys have. You basically get to every green and regulation. Yeah. And just me being able to just bomb a drive in front of everyone. Yeah. And then you just grind away at you. Sure. Yeah, I did it. I see that now. I do. What is your earliest memory? My earliest memory? I don't. I remember crying when my mum threw away my bottles. I remember sprinting to the bin. I've got this really weird fucking memory of when I was a kid and I was in my backyard and I shit myself and I walked inside and I don't know how like this happened, but obviously it didn't happen at the same time. And you know, like just around the house, like your parents have random decorations. Like there might be a bookshelf with like just some random thing there. There might be a vase with something on it, like a bowl. I just remember there were bread rolls like in all those things. Like there was Like a, like a nice, like big bowl, like design bowl, whatever, on like a bookshelf and there was a bread roll sitting in it. And then over here was another and I just walked in be like mom, I myself. And there were just bread rolls everywhere, brah. That's what I remember happening. And then I remember another time I used to sleep next. Like I used to put my, my mattress next to my mum and dad's bed because I was always scared of being kidnapped. So I used to sleep next to them and I woke up covered in once, like covered in. And I think it was my dog had shat in my bed and bro. And again in my mind I can remember me being like, I just rolled in mud. But it was poo. But it mustn't have been that much, obviously. And they're my two earliest memories for some reason. They're a shit. Yeah, a lot of poo related ones. Yeah. Or at one time I hid on. I told my parents to come find me and I hid under my bed, but I hid behind these tubs and obviously they looked under the bed but I'd hid really well behind these tubs. So they, after 20 minutes they were full freaking out and they had everyone on the street looking for me. They'd called the police and. And then I just popped out from under my bed being like, hey guys. And everyone was crying and be like, oh my God. And I was just like, oh, hey guys, I come here. I slept next to my parents bed bra till I was at an age. You shouldn't do it. I don't know. I don't know what age. Oh, let me, let me call my dad. Let me call my dad because he would have had the shits at it, bro. My mum would have been sweet with him. My dad would have been like, off, mate. Let's have a go. Yeah. Hey dad, quick question. You're on the podcast? Yeah. How old was I? You know, I used to put my mattress next to your bed. Oh, you better ask your mum that one. It was pretty old. But I like, I shouldn't have been doing it. I can't even remember you doing it. Oh, it's a mum question then. I thought you would have hated it, right? Oh, probably. I'll probably just left. Probably just put in another room when you went to sleep. Yeah, true. Righto. Right, I catch you you down on Friday. Yeah. Let's play golf. Might just play botany this week. All right, sweet. Local. Well, we haven't played for a while, so. Yeah, sweet. All right. I'll talk to you soon. Bye now. Dragged on a bit. Well, I reckon I was at. I don't know, I was an age. I was too. Too old. This is a good one. What is your least favorite thing about Will? My least favorite thing about Will? It's a great question. There's a lot of favorite things. My least favorite probably. Sometimes. How, I don't know. Sometimes he gets very. Like he thinks he's right and there's no other option and it's like. And it's not. It's not like a least favorite thing. Like there's nothing I don't like about him, but it's like this is a singer that pisses me off. That's what it would be. There's nothing you can't. There's nothing to hate about. Will is the. Is the best, but it drives me to the war when sometimes he's so adamant on something and I think I'm the same. And that's why I think we clash on those things. Because he's like, bro, you're so adamant. I'm like, bro, you're so adamant and we're both so stubborn on it. And so I would argue that that pisses him off just as much as it pisses me off. That's what I reckon. Last one. When's the next merch release? The next merch release is probably going to be in line with the regional tour we're doing. So about a month. And we're looking at hoodies and it's going to be extremely limited run. It's going to be sold at the tour. It's not going to be tour exclusive merch. Like it's not going to be merch about the tour, but it's going to be sold at the tour and if we have leftovers and we'll release them to the Patreon and then to the general public. So we're looking at hoodies. So keen to get a bit of interest there. I'm a first time hotline caller and that really intro really made me giggle. Nice work, boys. Anyway, Patty, this is for the soloette. I'm a Panther supporter, always have been. I've got a panther tattooed on me. Hell yeah. Cop a lot of heat for it. Whatever. I'm just wondering who your goat Penrith player is. Let us know. Thanks, bye. Well, listen, I'm gonna pull a bit of biased here and then tie it into the Roosters and say it's Brad Filler, you know what I mean? Because he played for both and he is a Champion player. And yeah, I've always got to bring the Roosters back into it. So I'm gonna. I'm gonna say Fiddler because he was a base at. At Panthers too. So was Girdler, from what I've heard. And mg, You've got some legends. Hey, Willing, how you going? I just wanted to just talk about that rack a. Rack a podcast that you guys were on. I just want to know more about that ghost story, Will, that you were talking about the place I used to live. Okay, thanks. Bye. That was you though, wasn't it? Yeah, that was me. Yeah, that was me. Yeah. There's not. There's not much else to tell. I lived in like a seven story house. This is the house where I'd laid in the shit. I remember this is where the dog shit. This is it. And there was seven stories. It was split level. So it was like two rooms on each level. Like, it was the most ridiculous thing ever. Like, it wasn't like, oh, you live in this mansion, was that. No, it was such a bad design. Down the bottom, there was a brick room. There was a missing brick. They say dogs can see ghosts. My dog started going nuts, jumping at the wall, licking the walls, chasing, like around the room. When my dog chased to where the missing brick was a little thing the size of, like, the size of the brick really, like the. The height of it, but not the width. It was shaped like an S and it was pure white, like a little S. And it zoomed past the brick as my dog chased it. And that's it. That's all there is to it. I've seen it. Hey, Clitty, it's real hard to take your side sometimes when you want to send a rubber ball band into space to hit a gas planet that it's gonna bounce off. Yeah. Jesus, mate. Come on, have a bit of fun, mate. How about that? What if it doesn't need a gas plan to hit something else? Just have a bit of fun. Jesus Christ. Hey, Patton, Will. I've got a bit of a wholesome one for you guys. I'm listening to the old pods and. And everything, like, because I've listened to all the new ones because I miss a tree. Anyways, I was listening to Pat and then so many of the episodes, he starts out being like, bruh, I'm just not feeling good today. Like, I feel off, I feel anxious. And ever since he started dating Tiana, he's had like 10 of those, like, times. Like, he never says it as much anymore. And it's kind of Holds him to be like, damn, like. And you can see what he. With Lonnie being all wholesome in the pod, like, anyway, just. Just yippee for Pat, and good to see you doing better. That's true. That is true. It's definitely. It's not so much that my anxiety and mental health is like, oh, it has gotten better. But I feel like it's. It's. It's easier to cope with, you know what I mean? So, like, obviously, I'm not. You can't rely on someone to fix that for you. That's not anyone's responsibility. But it is nice to have someone to comfort. And obviously, Tiana's been through some things, right? So she's a very empathetic person and is very understanding of things I go through, as am I to her. You know what I mean? So I feel like we complement each other in that sense. But it's not. Like, since I met her, everything's fixed. But I feel like it's nice to have someone that I can speak to and fully say, this is exactly what. You know what I mean? Like, sometimes I don't even like to tell people the extent. Well, I don't, because it's. But I. You know, she doesn't even know the extent either. But, like, I can tell her so many things of what's going on my mind without being feared, of judged, or, like, she's going to be like, you're a weirdo. Or, like, not a weirdo, but, like, that. That if I said some of the things that go through my head, right, and someone hadn't experienced it, they would want to send me to a home. You know what I mean? Like, they would want to put me in a jail cell. Like, they wouldn't want me in the public. But that's what happens with mental illness, right? And she can understand that. So I feel comfortable opening up to her and telling her those things. And with Lani, I was speaking about this to Tiana the other day, and I said, sometimes. Sorry, Tiana, you. Like, I. Sometimes she cops the. The worst of me when I'm just laying there on the lounge, not present with her, because I'm just like, I might be out with my friends and I put on a brave face, or I might be with people, and I put on a brave face. And then when I'm with her and I'm fully comfortable, I'm just like. But something about Lonnie, no matter what, I just seem to smile. And it's the same with Mimi. It's Both of them. It's those two girls. And I literally had this conversation, like, three nights ago. I don't know what it is because they're kids. It's just the energy they radiate. The smart. They instantly put a smile on my face and instantly make me feel better. And Lani is. I cried the other night to Tiana about Lani. I said how. How blessed I was to have her. She's just. Yeah. I don't know what it is. They just. They just radiate this beautiful energy to me. And, yeah, it's pretty cool. Pretty blessed. Hey, Pat Keen for the solo app today. I just have a fun fact for you to put into perspective. How much bigger a billion is compared to a million. So if you were to count to a million, you would take 12 days, but if you were to count to a billion, it would take you. Drumroll, please. Drumroll. 32 years. So I don't know if that's gonna blow your mind. Like, it blew my mind when I heard that, but I don't know. I think it's pretty insane. It would have if that was the first time I'd heard it. I hadn't heard it like that. I'd heard it put in another way of. It was another thing. I can't remember what it was. Think it might have been minutes in a day. There's 300. Can you look this up? The seconds. It's. It's saying, like, yeah, a million seconds is like something like 32 days or something. And a billion is like 30 years. Like, something crazy like that. Yeah. Millions, 11 days. A billion is a thou. Is 31 years. Yeah. So that. When I heard that, that's what put it into perspective. So, yes, you did blow me away. But more so if I'd heard that for the first time. That is crazy when you think about a millionaire compared to a billionaire, bro. Holy. Last one. Would you rather. Follow you, Pat. Would you rather have sex with Will or watch Will have sex with Tiana? Love you. I can't. Hell. That is such a hard question, bro. I think it would be something. You know what I mean? Like, obviously, I would never want Will having sex with Tiana, but, like, it's not like I would be sitting there like this jealous thing, you know what I mean? Because I know Will's gay. I know he wouldn't be enjoying it. I think we'd all be laughing together, saying about it. That's actually quite funny. You know what I mean? Obviously. Probably watch Will have sex with Town. I can't will, bro. And then obviously, like, yeah, it would. I feel like we'd all be laughing, watching Will have sex with a girl. I reckon it would just be hilarious. I don't know. That's a question. That is a really funny question. Right? Oh. Holy. How long did we do? Aaron 5. Aaron 5 of B. Clitty. You're probably sick of me if you made it this far. Apologies. I've got no idea if that was enjoyable or not, but appreciate you hanging around, appreciate your love, appreciate you for your bean spiller. Get in there because you're gonna hear another at least 20 minutes of me, which is a bit. And we're going on tour. Love you guys. Take care of yourselves. Get to your gp. Get a mental health plan. If you're struggling, you'll listen that go the blues. Roughies are flying like pigs favorites Folding like my cheap suit Saturday racing. Hey, you can't control luck, but you can control Ned's Punters Toolbox. While others tighten the screws, Ned's Punter's Toolbox blows it open. Use it this Saturday or any day to see what your bet slip can really do. What are you waiting for? Ned's TNCs apply. See Ned's website for details. Imagine what you could be buying instead.

Cuz Will, yesterday was like, hey bro, I'm going to Melbourne tomorrow. I was like, right, oh cunt. It's a little bit late notice. And I was like, fuck it. I could scavenge a last minute guest out and it's like, this is the thing about guests, it's got to be someone I know well, you know what I mean? Like I don't, I don't, I don't. I don't really want to sit down one on one with someone unless I'm genuinely interested in them, you know what I mean? And there was no one I'm genuinely interested in that I could get in the time frame. I'm not going to get someone for the sake of it. Obviously someone like my friends would have been fun too, but I was like it. I'm going to crank out a solo pod. We still got Kaiki here as well who's burping off camera. I'd love to know, Kyle, because it's the day of look, it's, it's. And I'm not even being a dickhead. It's seriously one of the greatest days of the year. Like, I love State of Origin. It is so good.

Few things to get through our Patreon. We were talking about it the other week, right. And Will brought up a great point. If you're not in the Patreon and you sign up now, you get to go back and watch all the old content. It's 455 hours of content. How many days is that? 465 is it couldn't be that many, could it?",

Tickets will go on sale. Look, I'm working around the clock at booking in venues. So hopefully next week tickets are going to go on sale early July. So get barred the up for that.

      "text": "So you can head to our YouTube at 6:00 clock and we're gonna. We sat down with Denny and Michael. Now listen, I don't know if we're going to be invited back because this is the thing we're gonna invited to like the proper press, like interviews. Right. With Danny and Michael for Bring Her Back. Now we were like, well, we can't go in there with two of the most chaotic people you've ever met. Me. And we're being pretty chaotic ourselves. We can't just. We're not just gonna be able to sit down and be like. So guys, tell us how your heart felt in. During this movie. You know, it's just not us. And we went in there all guns blazing and it was good fun, we enjoyed it. But we walked out of there going, holy Sony, absolutely hate us or love us. And there was. I don't think there was any in between. So head to the YouTube, check it out. Now, I was meant to watch the movie before and I didn't because that scares me over the last couple years. I love horror movies, but the last few years things like demons and ghosts and have really spooked me and send my anxiety through the roof. So I was like, I don't know if I want to go and watch it because Talk to Me. Their first movie I really loved, but I watched that before all this started, so it's going to be really similar Anyway. The premiere came around, everyone was going. Tiana really wanted to go. I was like, it. I'll just. I'll brave it out and I'll give it a crack. And boy, am I glad I did because Bring Her Back is such a good film. Like, it is really such a good movie. I'm not just saying this for the sake of it. Like, I would give my honest opinion. I gave it four stars on letterboxd. Let me read out my letterboxd review, actually, because it was just like. It wasn't scary in the sense of like, obviously it was scary. It was a horror. But it wasn't like a, oh, fuck, like what's gonna happen next horror. It was more like, oh, that's your. I sent Denny and Michael a mess saying, you kinds of twisted individuals for coming up with this. But it was amazing, you know what I mean? Like, that's what it's kind of like they portrayed the message. There's obviously a clear. A clear like theme, should I say, rather than a message. There's a clear theme in the movie that it's not hard to understand what it is that they portray really well. And just the way they did it all was so good. And again, you. I want Will to do a proper breakdown on it because he knows the more movie terms. I just really enjoyed it from a movie perspective. Me and Will always talk about how things make you feel. Like, how long does it take you to digest the movie and I you not. I'm still thinking about it the. The night after I Woke up at 4am and I couldn't get back to sleep for about half an hour to an hour as I just kept thinking of the movie. Not necessarily like scared. I just like, I was just processing it then the whole next day. Yesterday I was processing it and today I've still thought about it here and there. Like, it's a lot to break down and it's just. It's a great movie. Bring her Back. Four stars. Unfucking believable movie. I'm still processing it from last night. Twisted movie in a great way portrayed the message amazingly in just a proper of a doozy movie. That was what I said. So if you don't like horror, obviously it is horror, but it's not like your typical horror, you know what I mean? So I would recommend maybe giving it a go. Unless you're like fully against all that completely. But it wasn't. It's hard to explain. It wasn't like demonistic, like Talk to Me where like they're letting Demons inside them and stuff like this. It was more just the message and the way they did it was unbelievable. So I really recommend going and watch her bring her back. It was. It was great. Carl, after I just spilled my heart out about that movie. Do you reckon you'll go watch it?",

You don't like them. But my therapist always says to me, if you don't go do something, it's never going to improve your chances of going and doing it. You know what I mean? So, like, before I went to watch it, I was like, I really don't want to watch it. And then I just saw to my therapist being like, okay, but that then you're not growing or getting comfortable in an uncomfortable environment. You know what I mean? So, obviously I sat down and at the movies, I was quite uncomfortable, right? I don't like the movies in general because I find it boring to sit there and not talk for a period of time. And my mind just ticks over the first half an hour. Like when we sat down waiting for the movie to start, all I was thinking was, which I do everywhere I go, if a terrorist comes, how do I get out? You know what I mean? I was thinking for half an hour before the movie started, if a gunman walks in and starts shooting, could I put Tiana underneath the recliner chair and close the chair? And she would be tucked up under there and no one would see her, Right? You don't want to live in my brain. I promise you that. You don't want to. Where would you go? I'm running, bro. Hey, I'm not fitting under no recliner chair. But I've. I. I swear to God, bro, for 30 minutes, I'm. I'm wondering if Tiana could curl up in a ball and I close the recliner chair. Wouldn't that be a great Heidi?",

I'm not gonna gender terrorists, but in my experience of what I've seen, they're mostly males, but so, yeah, look, you don't want to be in my brain. But that's what I was thinking for the most part of the beginning of the movie. But then, yeah, my therapist always says you got to go and face these fears, otherwise you're never going to get over them, you know what I mean? And you never, you've got to get comfortable in them. So I did it and I'm glad I did because it was a great experience and a great movie. Now we're going to move on to a game we played in the Patreon last week. Some people calling it the greatest Patreon episode ever. I didn't think it was that good, but I thought it was fun. And it was called the ranking game where you rank things. So me and Will went through and ranked our favorite Aussie chocolates on like a tier list, you know what I mean? There's goat, there's like elite, there's ooh, put it in the bin, there's chat. Can't never touch it with a two foot pole, you know what I mean? There's all these things and mean we'll have to agree together. So I'm like, I want to do one of my own now. Not of chocolates, of course, of something different and see how we go. See what I rank just on my own, which I think will be a bit of fun. If anyone's still listening to this podcast, are you enjoying the pod? I am. Me too. But let me just say one thing. We're going on two 1. It's starting from the 26th, it's in literally like a week. So we're going to Melbourne, Adelaide, Perth, Brisbane and the final O show in Sydney. Get your ticks, be a part of the night of Nights, History of wars. If you like the podcast, see it live.

The single most overrated food chain in Australia. And it's not even a question, mate. The shittest Mexican you can get as takeaway is Guzman y Gomez in my opinion. And I'm putting it in. That's disgusting. Which is a bold call. But I don't like it, mate. I don't like. I don't not like it. Like don't get me. I don't bite it and go hey yuck, cunt. But I don't get it. You know what I mean? There's much better Mexican takeaway out there. Pizza Hut is. They're falling off the face of the earth. Pizza Huts, where I'm from, there's only one that I can think of and I haven't had it in years. So I'm gonna have to just go off. Why are they shutting down everywhere? Because it's not great. But I will say this. The old all you can eat Pizza Hut in Gold Coast. I don't know if you ever went to. It was unbelievable. I remember I was 10 and I ate so much pizza that I cried in the car park and we had to go home. I was in the car park trying to vomit and I was crying and everyone else was inside like taking it slow and I had like a self serve Mr. Whippy. They had everything and I was like, I'm in so much pain, mom, I gotta go home. And. And I made everyone leave and everyone was off me.",

That's what I reckon. What do we got next?",

A big one, a controversial one, because nothing screams feel amazing while eating and feel awful when you're done. Like kfc. You know what I mean? It's like. I don't know what. I don't know what to compare it to. You feel so good in the moment. Listen, it's like mdma. That's what KFC is like in the moment. There's not many things that come better than the Colonel. The next day after a cap, you feel rubbish. The next. As soon as you finish that last bit of kfc, you feel awful. And I don't get it. Heaps. But their popcorn chicken is so elite. It has to go in pretty good. It has to, but it is pretty good. But it may be a little bit overrated. But their popcorn chicken puts them. If there wasn't popcorn chicken, they're honestly in the. Not great. I reckon maybe they're in Nice. Nah, that's better than Domino's and Mad Max. Yeah, it's pretty good, but you do feel sick after it. Schnitz is an interesting one. If it was more accessible, I think I would eat it a lot more, but I don't. And then normally only in, like, food courts in, like, shopping centers where I've seen schnitz. And every time I've eaten it, it's been pretty nice. Been pretty nice. So I'd put it in.",

We come to a moment in the game where you reach the golden arches and you knew it was coming. We're talking takeaway. We're talking fast food. And it's not even a question.

I don't have it much, but when I've looked at it, I don't just want a roast chicken gravy roll takeaway. If I want one of them, I'll go to like a gourmet chicken shop. A Porto's All Porto's good, bro. A Porto's very good. I almost wanna. So I want to put it in pretty good, but it's a tier above kfc, I think. Put it in Ghost. I'm a sucker for like Portuguese chicken burgers, but it's not like Olay and that do it way better. Olay you've ever had Ole, brother. Have you had Olay, Willy? It's bruh. It's so. So the thing with Portuguese chicken burgers, I think they taste better at like a. I know Olay's got a couple restaurants, but more of an independent kind of place rather than a franchise. But Oporto, it does a job for you and it's in a ghost. Oliver's is not great, bro. You're getting it at the servo. No, Oliver's is. If I was starving. If I was starving, I'd eat it on a road trip, you know what I mean? Pie face. Don't. Haven't had enough. Get rid of Nando's. Say Will would throw this straight into goat, I reckon. But I'm gonna throw Nando's into. Look, it's good, but it's not. It's nice. Nando's is nice. It's nice. It's almost not great. Nah, it's nice. It deserves that Zambrero. Sombrero is pretty good. Their burritos really slap and that's all I've had from there. I'm a news. I'm a newcomer to zambrero. Like I said, I don't get Mexican takeaway that much. When I do, it's been zambrero lately. When I do, it's mainly only been a burrito and they go hard. Hogs say you can't. No idea. Krispy Kreme can. Hell, this is the last one. I don't know any others on there. Krispy Kreme. This is really throwing a spanner in the works, bruh. A Krispy Kreme donut. If you put a box in front of me and say to eat as many as you can, the calories don't count. I reckon I'd get close to 50. I seriously reckon I would, bro. They're so delicious, it's unbelievable. I'm gonna put them. I just. Nothing can sit in goat with maccas, you know what I mean? Maccas, I feel like earns a spot to sit by itself. So I got to put Krispy Kreme in Ghost also. It's a little bit less variety, you know what I mean? And there's My list. Goat Maccas, Ghost Sushi, Subway or Porto Krispy Kreme. Pretty good. Kfc, Donut King, Zambrero. Nice. Domino's, Mad Mex Schnitz, Grilled Hungry Jacks. Nando's not great. Pizza Hut, cold rock, Red Rooster. Put Red Rooster in if I was starving. Put Olivers in. That's disgusting. Not great. Pizza Hut, cold rock if I was starving. Rolled Red Rooster. That's disgusting. Guzman. Oliver's would rather starve to death. Nothing there. I want to put Nando's in Knock. Nah, Nando's is nice. Nando's is good. I like that. I'm happy with that to you.",

So when we were like five or six, I was like best friends with Shep. And then Will and Shep were also best friends from school and their families were really close, so we'd always go to the footy together. So, like Brad, Shep's dad, Jeremy, Will's dad. And then Brad would invite my dad and then all the kids would go, you know what I mean? And then Shep introduced me to Will. Then we all started becoming friends through the footy. And then whenever we'd go on family holidays, Shep would bring me along as like the plus one friend. So the Gibbs and the Shepherds would go away together. Then, hey, Will would bring one of his friends. Shep would bring one of his friends, which was me. And then we all just became friends through that, all got along and then started hanging out.",

And you know, like just around the house, like your parents have random decorations. Like there might be a bookshelf with like just some random thing there. There might be a vase with something on it, like a bowl. I just remember there were bread rolls like in all those things. Like there was Like a, like a nice, like big bowl, like design bowl, whatever, on like a bookshelf and there was a bread roll sitting in it. And then over here was another and I just walked in be like mom, I myself. And there were just bread rolls everywhere, brah. That's what I remember happening. And then I remember another time I used to sleep next. Like I used to put my, my mattress next to my mum and dad's bed because I was always scared of being kidnapped. So I used to sleep next to them and I woke up covered in once, like covered in. And I think it was my dog had shat in my bed and bro.

Because he's like, bro, you're so adamant. I'm like, bro, you're so adamant and we're both so stubborn on it. And so I would argue that that pisses him off just as much as it pisses me off.

Like it's not going to be merch about the tour, but it's going to be sold at the tour and if we have leftovers and we'll release them to the Patreon and then to the general public.

It's easier to cope with, you know what I mean? So, like, obviously, I'm not. You can't rely on someone to fix that for you. That's not anyone's responsibility. But it is nice to have someone to comfort. And obviously, Tiana's been through some things, right? So she's a very empathetic person and is very understanding of things I go through, as am I to her. You know what I mean? So I feel like we complement each other in that sense. But it's not. Like, since I met her, everything's fixed. But I feel like it's nice to have someone that I can speak to and fully say, this is exactly what. You know what I mean? Like, sometimes I don't even like to tell people the extent. Well, I don't, because it's. But I. You know, she doesn't even know the extent either. But, like, I can tell her so many things of what's going on my mind without being feared, of judged, or, like, she's going to be like, you're a weirdo. Or, like, not a weirdo, but, like, that. That if I said some of the things that go through my head, right, and someone hadn't experienced it, they would want to send me to a home. You know what I mean? Like, they would want to put me in a jail cell. Like, they wouldn't want me in the public. But that's what happens with mental illness, right? And she can understand that. So I feel comfortable opening up to her and telling her those things. And with Lani, I was speaking about this to Tiana the other day, and I said, sometimes. Sorry, Tiana, you. Like, I. Sometimes she cops the. The worst of me when I'm just laying there on the lounge, not present with her, because I'm just like, I might be out with my friends and I put on a brave face, or I might be with people, and I put on a brave face. And then when I'm with her and I'm fully comfortable, I'm just like. But something about Lonnie, no matter what, I just seem to smile. And it's the same with Mimi. It's Both of them. It's those two girls. And I literally had this conversation, like, three nights ago. I don't know what it is because they're kids. It's just the energy they radiate. The smart. They instantly put a smile on my face and instantly make me feel better. And Lani is. I cried the other night to Tiana about Lani. I said how. How blessed I was to have her. She's just. Yeah. I don't know what it is. They just. They just radiate this beautiful energy to me. And, yeah, it's pretty cool. Pretty blessed.",
